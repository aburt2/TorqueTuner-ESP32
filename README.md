# Probatio Torque Module: A Probatio module based on the stand alone Torquetune module which provides rotaryhaptic force feedback for digital musical instruments.

This repository is a fork of the TorqueTuner repository.  It ports the work over from an ESP32 board to an Arduino Nano board and uses the AccelStepper library to control the motor.
